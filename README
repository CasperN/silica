# Silica
Silica is an experimental (toy) systems programming language. 

See `Design.md` for the language design.

Silica is still in its early stages. I am currently building out the type
system. Once that's in place, I will build out the parser and backend code
generation. The design itself is relatively stable, however, I expect to make
changes as implementation reveals any flaws.
